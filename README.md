# Bookmarks for micro text editor

This plugin adds support for adding bookmarks while editing (lovingly adapted from codezapper https://github.com/codezapper/micro-bookmarks-plugin).

How to use:
- While editing, press the default key (F5) to set a bookmark at the current line.
- You can also use the command toggle_bookmark from the (Ctrl+E) prompt
- Press the default key (F6) to loop through all the bookmarks
- You can also use the command next_bookmark from the (Ctrl+E) prompt
- To remove a bookmark, press the default key again while the cursor is on the bookmarked line
